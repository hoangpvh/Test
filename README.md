## Directory Structure

### Atomic Design

We use [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) for organizing files in this project

- Atoms

  - Atoms are fundamental components, such as Button, Input, Text, etc
  - You shouldn't name it as a specific name, need to think it's reused in many places
  - Atoms shouldn't import any other components
- Molecules

  - Still should be abstruct but less than atoms, such as SearchButton, EmailInput, PasswordText, etc
  - Molecules can import only atoms and molecules
- Organisms

  - In this level, the UI can have features with combined molecues and atoms
  - It's less abstract than molecues but still need to think about being reused
    - e.g. AuthForm (Not LoginForm and SignUpForm)
  - Organisms can import only atoms, molecules and organisms
- Templates

  - Templates are quite different from Atoms, Molecules and Organism, it just defines the layout
  - **It shouldn't import any copmonents, it should receive copmonents as props**
- Pages

  - Pages are only concrete components, it doesn't need to be abstruct
  - Put Organisms (can be Molecules and Atoms) to Templates to build actual pages

Here is the example of the actual structure
